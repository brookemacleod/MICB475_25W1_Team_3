# Project Proposal Ideas

Idea 1: Houria!
- Dataset: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Dataset (student-sourced!!)
- Possible research questions: (Just some very rough ideas)
- 1) Do disease-modifying therapies for MS influence the gut microbiome composition? (Compare microbiome profiles of MS patients on different medications vs. untreated individuals)
  2) How do lifestyle or dietary factors modulate the microbiome in MS patients vs. healthy controls? (Use dietary metadata or lifestyle data (e.g., fiber intake, probiotic use, smoking) and assess interactions)

Idea 2: Houria!
- Dataset: Depression Dataset (student-sourced!!)
- Possible research questions:
- 1) How does HIV/HCV coinfection alone (independent of depression) impact gut microbiome diversity and composition? (Understanding the baseline impact of coinfection on the gut microbiome is important before layering mental health on top. Compare microbiomes of HIV-only vs. HIV/HCV coinfected individuals (if the dataset allows) or vs. healthy controls)
  2) Are there identifiable microbiome-based subtypes of depression in HIV/HCV coinfected individuals? (Depression is heterogeneous, maybe some forms are more microbiome-linked than others. Cluster participants based on microbiome profiles and compare depressive symptoms or severity)
